# iPython Notebook Style Guide

This document outlines the best practices and conventions for creating iPython notebooks for this project. Adhering to this guide will ensure consistency, clarity, and an optimal learning experience for our target audience.

**Note for Gemini Code Assist:** This file (`./gemini/styleguide-ipynb.md`) should be automatically included in the context when working on iPython notebooks within this project.

## 1. Target Audience

* **Level:** Late middle school / early high school students.
* **Prior Experience:** Assumed to have no prior programming experience.
* **Language:** Use clear, concise, and age-appropriate language. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it thoroughly if necessary.
* **Engagement:** Content should be engaging, relatable, and encouraging.
* **Tone:** Maintain an encouraging and professional tone. While enthusiasm is good, avoid overusing exclamation points to keep the content clear and readable.

## 2. Platform

* **Environment:** All notebooks will be developed for and hosted exclusively on **Google Colab**.
* **Colab Features:** Leverage Colab-specific features where beneficial (e.g., easy sharing, integration with Google Drive).
* **Compatibility:** Ensure all code and markdown renders correctly in Colab.

## 3. Notebook Structure & Content

* **Beginning of Notebook:**
  * **Title:** Clear and descriptive title.
  * **Summary/Introduction:** A brief overview of what the notebook covers and what the student will learn.
  * **Inspirational Quote:** Include a humorous or insightful quote from a scientist, mathematician, computer scientist, or historical figure that is relevant to the notebook's topic. This helps set the tone and provides context.
    * Where possible, link the author's name to their Wikipedia page to encourage further exploration (e.g., `> "..." ‚Äî Grace Hopper`).
    * **Callback (Optional):** If it feels natural, consider referring back to the quote later in the notebook. This can help reinforce the central theme or message of the lesson.
  * **Learning Objectives:** 2-3 bullet points outlining specific skills or knowledge students will gain.
  * **Prerequisites/Review:** A quick review of essential concepts from previous notebooks that will be used in the current one. Links to other notebooks must follow the format described in the **Linking Between Notebooks** section.
  * **Navigation:** At the end of the introduction, include a link back to the Table of Contents for easy navigation.
    * _Example:_ `[Return to Table of Contents](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/blob/main/notebooks/table-of-contents.ipynb)`
  * **Estimated Time:** Each notebook should be designed to be completed in approximately **30-60 minutes**.
    * Clearly state the estimated time at the beginning of the notebook.
* **End of Notebook:**
  * **Summary/Recap:** A concise summary of the key concepts covered in the notebook.
  * **Discussion Question (Meta-cognition):** Before the final summary, include an open-ended discussion question (`### ü§î Discussion Question:`) to encourage students to reflect on their learning process. For example: "Think back on the challenges in this notebook. Which concepts 'clicked' for you right away? Which ones were a bit tricky? What strategies did you use when you got stuck?"
  * **Key Takeaways:** Bullet points highlighting the most important points.
  * **Next Steps/Preview:** Briefly mention what will be covered in the next notebook or suggest further exploration. Any links must follow the format described in the **Linking Between Notebooks** section.
  * **Navigation:** At the very end of the notebook, include a link back to the Table of Contents. This link should be identical in format and text to the one used in the introduction to ensure a consistent user experience.
    * _Example:_ `[Return to Table of Contents](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/blob/main/notebooks/table-of-contents.ipynb)`

* **Interactivity & Engagement:**
  * **Minimum 1/3 Interactive Cells:** At least one-third of the cells in each notebook should be dedicated to interactive experimentation or mini-challenges.
  * **Code Cells:** Encourage students to run, modify, and experiment with code. Provide clear instructions and expected outputs.
  * **Markdown Cells:** Use markdown cells for explanations, instructions, and questions.

## 4. Section Icons and Decoration

Use consistent visual cues (e.g., emojis or icons) to denote different types of information. This helps students quickly identify the purpose of a section. **To ensure these sections appear in the notebook's table of contents, they should be formatted as markdown headers (e.g., `##` or `###`). As a general guideline, use `##` for major new topics and `###` for sub-topics, tips, and challenges.**

* `### üí° Tip:` For helpful hints, shortcuts, or best practices.
  * _Example: "`### üí° Tip:` You can use `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on Mac) to run a code cell in Colab!"_
* `### üéØ Mini-Challenge:` For small, focused coding exercises or tasks. Mini-challenges should follow a consistent structure to guide the student effectively, as seen in `03-basic-calculations.ipynb`.
  * To guide the student effectively, mini-challenges should follow a consistent **sequence of cells** without explicit numbering or labels like "Prompt" or "Solution".
    1. The challenge begins with a markdown cell containing the `### üéØ Mini-Challenge:` heading and the problem description.
    2. This is followed by an optional markdown cell containing one or more collapsible `<details>` blocks for hints.
        * **Writing Effective Hints:**
            * Break down complex problems into smaller, guided steps.
            * Use descriptive summaries for hints instead of generic labels like "Hint #1". For example, use `<summary>Hint: How do you find the side length?</summary>` or `<summary>Hint: The formula for the area of a circle</summary>`. This allows students to seek help for specific parts of the problem.
            * If a hint suggests calculating an intermediate value, it's helpful to provide the expected result (e.g., "After calculating the `outer_area`, its value should be `120`."). This helps students verify their progress.
    3. Next is the student's code cell, pre-populated with starter code and a `# YOUR CODE HERE` placeholder.
    4. Finally, a markdown cell provides the solution within a collapsible `<details>` block (e.g., `<summary>Click to see a possible solution</summary>`).
        * **Writing Effective Solutions:** The solution code should be well-commented and clearly demonstrate the steps to solve the problem.
        * **Show Intermediate Steps:** It is often helpful to show intermediate calculations (e.g., calculating `outer_area` and `inner_area` separately) to help students trace the logic and debug their own code.
        * **Show Expected Output:** Each `print()` statement in the solution should be followed by a comment showing the expected output. For `input()`, the comment should show a sample interaction.
        * _Example:_

            ```python
            # Solution code for a print statement
            print("The area is:", area)
            # Expected output: The area is: 50

            # Solution code for an input statement
            user_name = input("What is your name? ") # Sample interaction: What is your name? Ada
            ```

* `### üöÄ Pro-Tip:` For more advanced tips or insights for curious students.
  * _Example: "`### üöÄ Pro-Tip:` Python also supports f-strings for even more flexible string formatting. We'll explore those later!"_
* `## üêç New Concept:` When introducing a new Python command, programming concept, or key vocabulary.
  * _Example: "`## üêç New Concept:` Variables - Variables are like containers that store information."_
  * **Connect to Prior Knowledge:** When possible, explicitly connect the new concept to something students have already learned. Draw comparisons (e.g., "Just like an `if` statement, a function definition uses an indented block of code...") or highlight contrasts to prevent confusion (e.g., "Unlike the `+` operator with numbers, using `+` with strings joins them together instead of doing math.").
* `### ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads Up!:` For important distinctions, common pitfalls, or things students need to be particularly careful about.
  * _Example: "`### ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads Up!:` Python is case-sensitive, meaning `myVariable` and `myvariable` are different."_
* `### ü§î Discussion Question:` To prompt thought and reflection. These can be open-ended.
  * _Example: "`### ü§î Discussion Question:` Can you think of other situations where using a loop would be helpful?"_
* `### üîó External Resources:` For links to relevant external websites, videos, or articles.
  * _Example: "`### üîó External Resources:` For more about Python lists, check out the official Python documentation [link]."_
* `### üìö Learning More / Dig Deeper:` To suggest further exploration or optional advanced topics.
  * _Example: "`### üìö Learning More:` If you're interested in game development with Python, you might want to explore the Pygame library."_
* `### ‚úÖ Check Your Understanding:` For quick comprehension questions (e.g., multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank within a markdown cell).
  * _Example of a multiple-choice question:_

      ```markdown
        ### ‚úÖ Check Your Understanding:
        Which of the following is a Python keyword used to define a variable that stores a whole number?
        a) `string`
        b) `float`
        c) `int`
        d) `define`

        <!-- Answer: c) int -->
      ```

  * _Example with a revealable answer (useful in Colab):_

      ```markdown
        ### ‚úÖ Check Your Understanding:
        What would `print(5 + 3)` display?

        <details>
          <summary>Click to see the answer</summary>

          `8`
        </details>
      ```

* `## üéâ Milestone / Well Done!:` To acknowledge progress and provide encouragement after completing a significant section or challenge.

**Usage:**

* Place the icon and bolded title at the beginning of the relevant markdown cell or section.
* Be consistent with the chosen icons.

## 5. Code Cells

* **Clarity:** Code should be well-commented, especially when introducing new concepts.
* **Simplicity:** Use the simplest effective code to demonstrate concepts. Avoid overly complex or obscure syntax.
* **Step-by-Step:** Break down complex operations into smaller, manageable code cells.
* **Output:** Ensure code cells produce clear and understandable output. If an error is expected as part of a lesson, explain it.
* **Placeholders:** Use clear placeholders like `# YOUR CODE HERE` or `# TODO: ...` for student exercises.
* **Code conventions and formatting** should follow guidelines set up in `./styleguide.md`

## 6. Markdown Cells

* **Formatting:** Use markdown formatting (headings, bold, italics, lists, etc.) to structure content and improve readability.
* **Images/GIFs:** Use relevant images or GIFs to illustrate concepts or make the notebook more engaging, but ensure they are optimized for web and do not significantly increase loading times.
* **Image Linking:** All images stored in the repository must be linked using the full GitHub raw content URL to ensure they render correctly on all platforms (e.g., nbviewer, GitHub).
  * The URL must point to the `refs/heads/main` branch and include the full path from the repository root (e.g., `notebooks/images/your-image.png`).
  * _Example:_ `![A diagram showing a single variable box labeled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/refs/heads/main/notebooks/images/variable_vs_list.svg)`
* **Mathematical Formulas:** Use LaTeX for all mathematical formulas to visually distinguish them from Python code. This ensures they are rendered clearly and professionally.
  * _Example:_ `$$Area = \frac{base \times height}{2}$$` instead of `Area = (base * height) / 2`.
* **Conciseness:** Keep explanations clear and to the point.
* **Linking Between Notebooks** - When linking to another notebook in this project, use the standard Markdown link format `Link Text`. The URL must be the full Google Colab link that points to the GitHub repository. You can optionally append `#scrollTo=<cell-id>` to the URL to direct students to a specific cell within the target notebook.
  * _Example (link to specific section of a lesson):_

    ```markdown
    [Defining and calling functions (Notebook 5)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/blob/main/notebooks/05-reusable-code-with-functions.ipynb#scrollTo=1)
    ```

  * _Example (link to table of contents:_

    ```markdown
      [Return to Table of Contents](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/blob/main/notebooks/table-of-contents.ipynb)
    ```

## 7. General Best Practices

* **Test Thoroughly:** Run through the entire notebook as a student would to catch errors, typos, or confusing instructions.
* **Save Regularly:** Encourage students to save their work (though Colab autosaves).
* **Iterative Improvement:** Be open to feedback and iterate on notebook content to improve the learning experience.
