# Programming-and-Problem-Solving (paps)  Project Description

## Summary

This document outlines the project goals, software development practices, and standards
for the PAPS (Programming and Problem Solving) project. This is a living document that can be used by both humans and
AI agents as a source of guiding principles when contributing to the PAPS project.

## Project Goals

The PAPS project will provide a set of Jupyter notebooks that should serve as a complete set of self-study materials for
students between 13-16 years old.

1) Assume no prior exposure to programmming.

2) Assume the students will run the Jupyter notebooks on Google's Colab service since it will provide a zero-installation platform.

3) Programming should be presented as a versatile tool applicable across many disciplines. Explanations and examples should be pragmatic, demonstrating how programming aids understanding in subjects like mathematics (e.g., using iterations for better estimates), finance (e.g., understanding loan interest), science (e.g., simulating simple phenomena or visualizing data), or even language arts (e.g., basic text analysis).


## Technology Choices

1) The project's primary language will be Python

2) The project will assume that the notebooks will always be run on Google colab, so any descriptions of the Jupyter notebook interface should refer to what Google Colab presents.

## Project Deliverables

1) There will be a set of Jupyter notebooks
  * Each notebook should take approximately 30-60 minutes for a student to work through.
  * Each notebook should have many opportunities for students to experiment.

2) The first 2-3 notebooks will cover
  * Working with Jupyter and Colab
  * Basic Markdown
  * Python
    * Variables
    * Types - simplified to strings and numbers
    * Using print()
    * Reading errors: learning to understand common error messages and basic debugging strategies.
  * What is programming?
  * Tools for problem solving
    * Mental models - compare to models of an atom with different levels of sophistication
    * Layers of abstraction

3) Additional notebooks will be based on extended case studies of specific challenges
  * These challenges should be engaging
  * New Python concepts and techniques should be introduced as needed
    * functions
    * data structures
      * tuples
      * lists
      * dicts
    * classes (why do we use the ".function()" syntax on some things)
  * New problem solving techniques should be introduced as needed
  * There should be open-ended discussion questions
  * There should be a 'going further' question that encourages students to continue digging deeper after the 'end' of the notebook.

## AI Assistant Interaction Style

When asked to perform a "review" of a file or a concept, please follow this process:

1.  **High-Level Summary:** Begin with a high-level summary of the item being reviewed. Mention its strengths and any major areas for improvement.
2.  **Step-by-Step Plan:** Propose a detailed, step-by-step plan to address the identified areas for improvement. Each step should be small, incremental, and self-contained so that it can be approved and implemented individually.
3.  **Await Approval:** After presenting the plan, wait for approval before proceeding with the first step.
