# Programming-and-Problem-Solving (paps)  Project Description

## Summary

This document outlines the project goals, software development practices, and standards
for the PAPS (Programming and Problem Solving) project. This is a living document that can be used by both humans and
AI agents as a source of guiding principles when contributing to the PAPS project.

## Project Goals

The PAPS project will provide a set of Jupyter notebooks that should serve as a complete set of self-study materials for 
students between 13-16 years old.  

1) Assume no prior exposure to programmming.

2) Assume the students will run the Jupyter notebooks on Google's Colab service since it will provide a zero-installation platform.

3) Programming should be presented as a versitile tool that can be used in many disciplines.  The explainations and examples presented in the course should all be very pragmatic and demonstrate how programming can help students to further their understanding in other subjects.  


## Technology Choices

1) The project's primary language will be Python

2) The project will assume that the notebooks will always be run on Google colab, so any descriptions of the Jupyter notebook interface should refer to what Google Colab presents.

## Project Deliverables

1) There will be a set of Jupyter notebooks
  * Each notebook should take approximately 30-60 minutes for a student to work through.
  * Each notebook should have many opportunities for students to experiment.

2) The first 2-3 notebooks will cover

3) Additional notebooks will be based on extended case studies of specific challenges
  * These challenges should be engaging
  * New Python concepts and techniques should be introduced as needed
  * New problem solving techniques should be introduced as needed
  * There should be open-ended discussion questions
  * There should be a 'going further' question that encourages students to continue digging deeper after the 'end' of the notebook.
