    "# Notebook 5: Reusable Code with Functions üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our fifth Python notebook! In the last lesson, you learned how to make your programs interactive by getting input from the user. Now, we'll learn how to make our code more organized and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore one of the most powerful ideas in programming: **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple.\" ‚Äî Grady Booch\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the magic of functions! They allow us to take a complex set of steps, wrap them up in a simple, reusable command, and give it a clear name. This helps us manage complexity and build powerful programs from simple pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Define your own functions using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "*   Pass information to functions using **parameters**.\n",
    "*   Get results back from functions using the `return` keyword.\n",
    "*   Understand the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 30-40 minutes\n",

    "Imagine you need to calculate the area of a square many times in your program. You could copy and paste the calculation code (`side * side`) everywhere, but that's repetitive and if you make a mistake in one place, you have to fix it everywhere!\n",

    "A **function** is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You can \"call\" a function by its name whenever you need to perform that task.\n",

    "*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Write the code once, use it many times.\n",
    "*   **Organization:** Break down your program into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "*   **Readability:** Makes your code easier to understand because complex tasks are hidden inside well-named functions.\n",
    "*   **Reusability:** You can use the same function in different parts of your program, or even in different programs."

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):\n",
    "    # Code to perform the task goes here (this is the function body)\n",
    "    # This code must be indented!\n",

    "*   `def`: The keyword that tells Python you're defining a function.\n",
    "*   `function_name`: You choose this! Follow the same naming rules as variables (e.g., `snake_case`).\n",
    "*   `parameter1, parameter2`: These are like special variables that act as placeholders for values you'll give to the function when you call it. These are also called **arguments** when you provide actual values. A function can have zero, one, or many parameters.\n",
    "*   `:`: A colon marks the end of the function definition line.\n",
    "*   **Indented Code Block:** The lines of code *inside* the function that do the work. They **must** be indented (usually 4 spaces).\n",
    "*   `return result` (Optional): The `return` keyword sends a value back from the function to the part of your code that called it. If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it automatically returns a special value `None`."
