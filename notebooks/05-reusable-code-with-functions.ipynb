Since our code will be read by others (and our future selves!) many times, it's crucial to make it as clear and understandable as possible. Functions are one of the best tools we have for organizing our thoughts and making our code readable.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):\n",
    "    # Code to perform the task goes here (this is the function body)\n",
    "    # This code must be indented!\n",
    "    result = parameter1 + parameter2 # Example operation\n",

    "*   `def`: The keyword that tells Python you're defining a function.\n",
    "*   `function_name`: You choose this! Follow the same naming rules as variables (e.g., `snake_case`).\n",
    "*   `parameter1, parameter2`: These are special variables that act as placeholders for the values (called **arguments**) you'll give to the function when you call it. A function can have zero, one, or many parameters.\n",
    "*   `:`: A colon marks the end of the function definition line.\n",
    "*   **Indented Code Block:** The lines of code *inside* the function that do the work. They **must** be indented (usually 4 spaces).\n",
    "*   `return result` (Optional): The `return` keyword sends a value back from the function to the part of your code that called it. If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it automatically returns a special value `None`."

    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that we're using another word, \"function,\" that you've probably seen before in math class. Just like we saw with the word \"variable,\" the term \"function\" has a very similar, but subtly different, meaning in programming. It's helpful to understand the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarities:**\n",
    "*   Both take inputs (which we call **parameters** in Python and often see as variables like `x` in math) and produce an output (using the `return` keyword in Python).\n",
    "*   The idea of mapping an input to a specific output is the same. The mathematical function $$f(x) = x^2$$ is very similar to the Python function:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def f(x):\n",
    "        return x**2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "*   **Side Effects:** A mathematical function is \"pure\"‚Äîits only job is to return a value based on its inputs. A Python function can do much more! It can have **side effects**, like printing to the screen, saving a file, or asking the user for input. The `print()` function is a perfect example: its main job isn't to return a value, but to cause something to appear on the screen.\n",
    "*   **State:** A mathematical function will always give you the same output for the same input. `f(5)` will always be `25`. A Python function's output can sometimes depend on things other than its direct inputs (like a global variable that might have changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking of Python functions as \"recipes\" or \"a set of instructions\" is often more accurate than thinking of them purely as mathematical functions. They are blocks of code that we can run on command, which might or might not return a value."

    "\n",
    "Look at how clean and readable the solution is! The `calculate_surface_area_of_pyramid` function doesn't need to know *how* to calculate the area of a square; it just needs to know that there's a tool (`calculate_square_area`) that can do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is called **composition**. We are *composing* a larger, more complex function from smaller, simpler ones. This directly relates to the quote at the start of this notebook‚Äîbecause code is read so often, making it clear and easy to understand is one of our most important goals. Using composition helps us achieve that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits are huge:\n",
    "*   **Readability:** The code almost reads like a plain-English recipe. It's clear that we're calculating a base area and a triangle area and then combining them.\n",
    "*   **Reliability:** We already know `calculate_square_area` works. By reusing it, we reduce the chance of making a new typo or logic error.\n",
    "*   **Maintainability:** If we ever found a better way to calculate the area of a triangle, we would only need to update the `calculate_triangle_area` function. Every other function that uses it (like our pyramid function) would automatically get the benefit of that improvement without any changes."
