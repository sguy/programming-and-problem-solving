    "# Notebook 8: Mastering Loops üîÅ\n",
    "> \"Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.\" - *Vincent van Gogh*\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our eighth Python notebook! You've learned how to make decisions with `if` statements and how to organize data with `lists`. Now, we're going to learn one of the most powerful concepts in programming that will save you a ton of time and effort: **loops**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow you to repeat a block of code over and over again, which is essential for working with lists, processing data, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Understand the concept of **iteration** and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n",
    "*   Use `for` loops with `range()` to repeat actions a specific number of times.\n",
    "*   Use `for` loops to iterate directly over items in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 35-50 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites/Review:**\n",
    "*   Concepts from [Notebook 6: Python's Decision Power](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/blob/main/notebooks/06-decisions.ipynb) (Conditional Statements (`if`/`else`))\n",

    "## üêç New Concept: The Power of Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you wanted to print a countdown from 5 to 1. Without loops, you might write code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(5)\n",
    "print(4)\n",
    "print(3)\n",
    "print(2)\n",
    "print(1)\n",
    "print(\"Blast off!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works, but it's very repetitive. What if you wanted to count down from 100? You would have to write 100 `print()` statements! This goes against a very important principle in programming called **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRY principle means that you should avoid writing the same code over and over again. Repetitive code is harder to read, harder to change, and more likely to have bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **loops** come to the rescue. A loop is a control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times. This process of repetition is called **iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on the `for` loop, which is perfect for when you know how many times you want to repeat an action or when you want to do something for every single item in a collection (like a list)."

    "## üêç New Concept: `for` Loops with Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and powerful way to use a `for` loop is to do something for **every single item in a list**. This is one of the most common and powerful patterns in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give the `for` loop a list directly. The loop will automatically go through the list, and in each iteration, the loop variable will hold the next item from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the `for` loop syntax piece by piece:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for item_variable in my_list:`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `for`: This is the keyword that starts the loop.\n",
    "*   `item_variable`: This is a **loop variable** that you name. In each pass through the loop, this variable will hold the *current item* from the list. You can name it anything descriptive (e.g., `friend` for a list of friends, `score` for a list of scores).\n",
    "*   `in`: This is another keyword. It links the loop variable with the list you want to iterate over.\n",
    "*   `my_list`: This is the list that the loop will go through, one item at a time.\n",
    "*   `:`: The colon at the end is crucial! It signifies the beginning of the indented block of code that will be executed for each item. We've seen this before with `if` statements and function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **indented block of code** below the `for` line is the body of the loop. These are the instructions that will be repeated for each item in the list. The rules for indentation are exactly the same as for `if`/`else` statements."

    "Consider a list: `letters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`\n",

    "1.  **Length:** The number of items is `len(letters)`, which is **3**.\n",
    "2.  **Indices:** Because indexing starts at 0, the valid indices for this list are **0, 1, and 2**. The last valid index is always `len(letters) - 1`.\n",
    "3.  **Range:** The function call `range(3)` generates the sequence of numbers **0, 1, and 2**.\n",

    "**The Connection:**\n",

    "The sequence of numbers generated by `range(len(my_list))` is **exactly the same as the sequence of valid indices for `my_list`**.\n",

While looping directly over the list (`for item in my_list`) is often simpler, this index-based method is very useful when you need to know the *position* of an item."
