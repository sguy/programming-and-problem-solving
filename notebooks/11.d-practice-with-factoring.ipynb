    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we saw how breaking a complex problem down into smaller, more manageable functions can make the problem much easier to solve. We built a set of tools (`get_prime_factorization`, `factors_to_number`, `intersect_factors`, `union_factors`) that we could then combine to create our final `gcf` and `lcm` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you were building these functions, did you find it helpful to test each one as you wrote it? This process of breaking down problems and testing the small pieces is a fundamental skill in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The GCF of two numbers corresponds to the *intersection* of their prime factorizations.\n",
    "*   The LCM of two numbers corresponds to the *union* of their prime factorizations.\n",
    "*   Complex problems can often be solved by composing simpler functions together.\n",
