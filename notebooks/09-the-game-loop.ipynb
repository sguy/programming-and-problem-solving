    "Welcome to our ninth Python notebook! You've learned how to repeat actions a specific number of times with `for` loops. Now, we're going to explore a new kind of loop that's perfect for situations where you don't know how many times you need to repeat, like in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build some simple, interactive games. Along the way, we'll learn about the **game loop**, a fundamental concept in game development, and a new type of loop called the `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Understand the concept of a **game loop** (initialize, loop, update, check for end).\n",
    "*   Use `while` loops to repeat actions until a certain condition becomes false.\n",
    "*   Understand the idea of a \"black box\" function‚Äîa tool you can use without needing to know its internal workings.\n",
    "*   Use a provided `random_number()` function to add unpredictability to your programs.\n",

    "## üêç New Concept: The `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, you mastered the `for` loop. A `for` loop is perfect when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something (e.g., for every item in a list, or 10 times using `range(10)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you don't know how many times you need to loop? What if you want to keep doing something *until a certain condition is met*?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the `while` loop comes in. A `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as a specified condition is `True`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "*   A `for` loop is like saying, \"Do this 10 times.\"\n",
    "*   A `while` loop is like saying, \"Keep doing this *while* the light is green.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax looks like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code to repeat as long as the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` is a Boolean expression, just like the ones you used in `if` statements. The loop will check the condition, and if it's `True`, it will run the indented code block. Then it will go back and check the condition again. It keeps repeating this process until the condition finally becomes `False`."

    "The most common mistake when using a `while` loop is creating an **infinite loop**. This happens when the loop's condition *never* becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example above, what would happen if we forgot the line `counter = counter + 1`? The `counter` variable would always be `1`, the condition `counter <= 5` would always be `True`, and the loop would run forever, printing `\"The current number is: 1\"` over and over again.\n",
