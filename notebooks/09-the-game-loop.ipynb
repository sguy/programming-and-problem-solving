    "Welcome to our ninth Python notebook! You've learned how to repeat actions a specific number of times with `for` loops. Now, we're going to explore a new kind of loop that's perfect for situations where you don't know how many times you need to repeat, like in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build some simple, interactive games. Along the way, we'll learn about the **game loop**, a fundamental concept in game development, and a new type of loop called the `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Understand the concept of a **game loop** (initialize, loop, update, check for end).\n",
    "*   Use `while` loops to repeat actions until a certain condition becomes false.\n",
    "*   Understand the idea of a \"black box\" function‚Äîa tool you can use without needing to know its internal workings.\n",
    "*   Use a provided `random_number()` function to add unpredictability to your programs.\n",

    "## üêç New Concept: The `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, you mastered the `for` loop. A `for` loop is perfect when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something (e.g., for every item in a list, or 10 times using `range(10)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you don't know how many times you need to loop? What if you want to keep doing something *until a certain condition is met*?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the `while` loop comes in. A `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as a specified condition is `True`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "*   A `for` loop is like saying, \"Do this 10 times.\"\n",
    "*   A `while` loop is like saying, \"Keep doing this *while* the light is green.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax looks like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code to repeat as long as the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` is a Boolean expression, just like the ones you used in `if` statements. The loop will check the condition, and if it's `True`, it will run the indented code block. Then it will go back and check the condition again. It keeps repeating this process until the condition finally becomes `False`."

    "1.  The game picks two random numbers, `A` and `B`, between `0` and `12`.\n",
    "2.  It presents the problem on screen: `A * B = ?`\n",

    "4.  The game ends when:\n",
    "    *   The user gets a total of 3 questions incorrect.\n",
    "    *   The user gets 3 questions correct *in a row*.\n",
    "5.  The user's final score is calculated as: `(total number correct * 2) - (total number incorrect)`\n",
    "6.  At the end of the game, print the user's name and their final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think** about how you can break down this problem into smaller, manageable pieces. Consider creating your own helper functions (e.g., `get_random_problem()`, `check_answer()`, `display_score()`) to make your code easier to understand and manage."

    "*   The **game loop** is a pattern used to keep a game running and responsive.\n",
