    "## üìú What is the Caesar Cipher?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's named after Julius Caesar, who, according to some ancient writers, used it to communicate with his generals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "It's a type of **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext (the original message) is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This fixed number is called the **shift** or the **key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with a **shift of 3**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Original Letter | Shifted by +3 | Encoded Letter |\n",
    "| :-------------- | :------------ | :------------- |\n",
    "| A               | A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D | D              |\n",
    "| B               | B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D ‚Üí E | E              |\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/refs/heads/main/notebooks/images/caesar-cipher-wheel.jpg' width=300px>\n",
    "| X               | X ‚Üí Y ‚Üí Z ‚Üí A | A              |\n",
    "| Y               | Y ‚Üí Z ‚Üí A ‚Üí B | B              |\n",
    "| Z               | Z ‚Üí A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C | C              |\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the message \"HELLO\" with a shift of 3 would be encryptd as \"KHOOR\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Caesar ciphers are often depicted as a pair of nested circles since the shifts 'wrap' over the end of the alphabet from Z back to A.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a possible plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Understand Character Shifting:** How do we take a single letter (e.g., 'A') and a shift value (e.g., 3) and find the new letter (e.g., 'D')? We'll need to think about the alphabet and how to handle wrapping around from 'Z' back to 'A'.\n",

    "2.  **Encode a Single Character:** Write a function that takes one character and a shift value, and returns the encryptd character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Encode an Entire Message:** Once we can encrypt one character, how do we encrypt a whole message? We'll probably need to go through the message letter by letter and encrypt each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Decode a Single Character:** How is decoding related to encoding? If encoding 'A' with shift 3 gives 'D', how do we get back from 'D' to 'A' using the same shift value?\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Decode an Entire Message:** Similar to encoding, if we can decrypt one character, we can decrypt a whole message.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Here's a recap of what you learned and built:**\n",
    "*   The **Caesar Cipher** works by shifting letters a fixed number of places in the alphabet.\n",
    "*   Python's `ord()` and `chr()` functions are essential for converting between characters and their numerical (ASCII/Unicode) values, which allows us to do math with letters.\n",
    "*   The **modulo operator (`%`)** is crucial for handling the \"wrap-around\" effect in the alphabet (e.g., 'Z' + 1 = 'A').\n",
    "*   String methods like `.upper()` help simplify text processing.\n",
    "*   **`for` loops** allow you to iterate through each character of a string to perform operations like encoding or decoding.\n",
    "*   You built functions (`encrypt_char`, `encrypt_message`, `decrypt_char`, `decrypt_message`) to create a modular and reusable cipher tool.\n",
    "*   You thought about the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle when comparing encoding and decoding logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "*   Complex problems can be broken down into smaller, manageable functions.\n",
    "*   Understanding how characters are represented as numbers opens up many possibilities for text manipulation.\n",
    "*   Loops are fundamental for processing items in a sequence (like characters in a string or items in a list).\n",
