    "\n",
    "Once you start working on a notebook, especially if you've opened a shared one (like this one!) or want to keep your own copy with your changes, you'll want to save it to your own Google Drive.\n",

    "**How to Save:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Go to `File` in the menu bar** at the top-left of the Colab interface.\n",
    "2.  You'll see a few save options:\n",
    "    *   **`Save a copy in Drive`**: This is usually what you want. It creates a new copy of the current notebook in your Google Drive. Jupyter will often automatically put it in a folder called \"Colab Notebooks\" in the main part of your Drive.\n",
    "    *   `Save`: If you've already saved a copy to your Drive, or if you created a new notebook directly in Colab, this will save the current changes to that file in your Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working with Notebooks from Google Drive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Saving Your Changes:** Once a notebook is in your Google Drive, any changes you make and `Save` (or that Jupyter auto-saves) will be updated in your Drive version. You own this copy.\n",
    "*   **Opening from Drive:** You can open your `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) files directly from Google Drive! Just find the file in your Drive, right-click on it (or double-click), and choose `Open with > Google Colaboratory`.\n",
