    "Welcome back, agent! In our last notebook, you learned the fundamental vocabulary of cryptography, including the critical difference between **encoding** and **encrypting**. Now, it's time to put that knowledge into practice by building our first real encryption program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll implement the famous and ancient **Caesar Cipher**. We will treat this as an **encryption pipeline**, breaking the problem down into distinct encoding and encrypting steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Reinforce the difference between encoding and encrypting through implementation.\n",
    "*   Use `ord()` and `chr()` to build an character-to-number codec.\n",
    "*   Apply the modulo operator (`%`) to perform a mathematical shift on numerical data.\n",
    "*   Combine codec and cipher functions to build a complete encryption/decryption pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "It's a type of **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext (the original message) is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This fixed number is called the **shift** or the **key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with a **shift of 3**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Original Letter | Shifted by +3 | Encrypted Letter |\n",
    "| :-------------- | :------------ | :------------- |\n",
    "| A               | A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D | D              |\n",
    "| B               | B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D ‚Üí E | E              |\n",
    "| ...             | ...           | ...            |\n",
    "| Z               | Z ‚Üí A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C | C              |\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the message \"HELLO\" with a shift of 3 would be encrypted as \"KHOOR\". To decrypt it, the receiver simply shifts each letter back by 3 positions."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Encode:** Convert each letter of our plaintext message into a number. The resulting list of numbers is still a form of **plaintext**!\n",
    "2.  **Encrypt:** Take each number and apply the secret key. The result is a list of encrypted numbers. Now the data is **ciphertext**.\n",

    "Congratulations, Agent! You've successfully implemented the Caesar Cipher in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a recap of what you learned and built:**\n",
    "*   The **Caesar Cipher** works by shifting letters a fixed number of places in the alphabet.\n",
    "*   Python's `ord()` and `chr()` functions are essential for converting between characters and their numerical (ASCII/Unicode) values, which allows us to do math with letters.\n",
    "*   The **modulo operator (`%`)** is crucial for handling the \"wrap-around\" effect in the alphabet (e.g., 'Z' + 1 = 'A').\n",
    "*   String methods like `.upper()` help simplify text processing.\n",
    "*   **`for` loops** allow you to iterate through each character of a string to perform operations like encoding or decoding.\n",
    "*   You built functions (`encode_char`, `encode_message`, `decode_char`, `decode_message`) to create a modular and reusable cipher tool.\n",
    "*   You thought about the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle when comparing encoding and decoding logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "*   Complex problems can be broken down into smaller, manageable functions.\n",
    "*   Understanding how characters are represented as numbers opens up many possibilities for text manipulation.\n",
    "*   Loops are fundamental for processing items in a sequence (like characters in a string or items in a list).\n",

    "In our next notebook, [üî¢ Notebook 8: Prime Numbers - A Problem-Solving Adventure!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sguy/programming-and-problem-solving/blob/main/notebooks/09-prime-numbers.ipynb), we'll switch gears from secret codes to number theory as we explore **Prime Numbers**. We'll learn how to determine if a number is prime and generate lists of primes, using and reinforcing concepts like loops and conditional logic in a new context.\n",

    "**Going Further (Optional Challenges):**\n",

    "*   What about numbers? Should they be shifted too, or left alone?\n",
    "*   The Caesar cipher is quite easy to break. Can you think why? (Hint: letter frequency). Research other simple ciphers like the Vigen√®re cipher (which is much stronger!).\n",
