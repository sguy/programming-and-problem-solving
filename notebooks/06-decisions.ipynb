    "\n",
    "Let's extend our movie ticket pricer to handle discounts. This will require using **nested logic** (an `if` statement inside another `if` or `else` block).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your program should:**\n",
    "1.  First, calculate the base ticket price based on age, just like before:\n",
    "    *   Under 5: $0\n",
    "    *   5-12: $5\n",
    "    *   13+: $10\n",
    "2.  Then, ask the user if they have a coupon (e.g., 'yes' or 'no').\n",
    "3.  **If they have a coupon:** Ask for the coupon amount (e.g., a number like `2` for $2 off) and apply the discount.\n",
    "4.  **If they do not have a coupon:** Ask them for the day of the week. If it's 'Wednesday', apply a 20% discount to their ticket price.\n",
    "5.  **Final Rule:** The final ticket price can never be less than $0. If a discount makes the price negative, it should be adjusted to $0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the final ticket price."
