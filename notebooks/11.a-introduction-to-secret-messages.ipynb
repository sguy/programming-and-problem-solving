    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "*   **Plaintext** is the original, readable message; **Ciphertext** is the transformed, unreadable message.\n",
    "*   **Encoding** changes a message's format for public purposes (e.g., compression, universal readability), and the encoded data is still considered plaintext.\n",
    "*   **Encrypting** hides a message's content for private purposes, requiring a secret key to decrypt.\n",
    "*   Python's `ord()` and `chr()` functions are essential tools for converting between characters and their numerical representations, forming the basis of many codecs.\n",
    "*   Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions (like `encode_to_ascii` and `decode_from_ascii`) is a powerful programming strategy.\n",
