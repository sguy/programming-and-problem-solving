    "# Notebook 4: Interactive Programs üí¨\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our fourth Python notebook! In the last lesson, you learned how to use Python for basic arithmetic to calculate properties of shapes. That's a great start.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, those programs were a bit rigid because the numbers were \"hardcoded.\" In this notebook, we'll make our programs much more powerful and flexible by learning how to get input directly from the user.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the moment our programs stop being just about what *we* tell them to do and start being about what the *user* wants to do. Getting user input is the first step to creating a great experience for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "*   Use the `input()` function to get data from a user.\n",
    "*   Understand why `input()` always returns a string.\n",
    "*   Convert strings to numbers for calculations using `int()` and `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 25-35 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites/Review\n",
    "*   Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, etc.) from Notebook 3: Basic Calculations.\n",
    "*   Variables and the `print()` function from Notebook 2: First Steps with Python.\n",

    "1.  It displays a message (called a **prompt**) to the user, asking them to type something.\n",
    "2.  It waits for the user to type their response and press Enter.\n",
