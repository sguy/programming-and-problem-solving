    "# Notebook 4: Interactive Programs üí¨\n",

    "Welcome to our fourth Python notebook! In the last lesson, you learned how to use Python for basic arithmetic to calculate properties of shapes. That's a great start!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, those programs were a bit rigid because the numbers were \"hardcoded.\" In this notebook, we'll make our programs much more powerful and flexible by learning how to get input directly from the user!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Use the `input()` function to get data from a user.\n",
    "*   Understand why `input()` always returns a string.\n",
    "*   Convert strings to numbers for calculations using `int()` and `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 25-35 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites/Review:**\n",
    "*   Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, etc.) from Notebook 3: Basic Calculations.\n",
    "*   Variables and the `print()` function from Notebook 2: First Steps with Python.\n",
