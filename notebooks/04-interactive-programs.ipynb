    "# Notebook 4: Interactive Programs üí¨\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our fourth Python notebook! In the last lesson, you learned how to use Python for basic arithmetic to calculate properties of shapes. That's a great start!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, those programs were a bit rigid because the numbers were \"hardcoded.\" In this notebook, we'll make our programs much more powerful and flexible by learning how to get input directly from the user!\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the moment our programs stop being just about what *we* tell them to do and start being about what the *user* wants to do. Getting user input is the first step to creating a great experience for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Use the `input()` function to get data from a user.\n",
    "*   Understand why `input()` always returns a string.\n",
    "*   Convert strings to numbers for calculations using `int()` and `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 25-35 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites/Review:**\n",
    "*   Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, etc.) from Notebook 3: Basic Calculations.\n",
    "*   Variables and the `print()` function from Notebook 2: First Steps with Python.\n",

    "1.  It displays a message (called a **prompt**) to the user, asking them to type something.\n",
    "2.  It waits for the user to type their response and press Enter.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Here's a recap of what you learned:**\n",
    "*   **Getting User Input:** You learned to use the `input()` function to ask the user for information and make your programs interactive.\n",
    "*   **The String Rule:** You discovered that `input()` always returns a **string**, even if the user types numbers.\n",
    "*   **Converting Data Types:** You practiced using `int()` and `float()` to convert those input strings into numbers so you can perform calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "*   Data types are crucial! You must ensure your data is in the correct format (e.g., a number) before you can perform operations like multiplication on it.\n",
    "*   Your programs are no longer static! By getting user input, you can create tools that solve different problems every time they run.\n",

    "In our next notebook, we'll learn how to organize our code into reusable blocks called **functions**. This will help us avoid repeating code and make our programs much easier to read and manage."
