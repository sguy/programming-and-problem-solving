    "3.  **Break It Into Smaller Pieces:** Complex problems are easier to solve if you tackle smaller, manageable parts first. This is key!\n",

    "    *   Numbers less than 2 (0, 1, and negative numbers) are NOT prime.\n",
    "    *   The number 2 is the smallest prime number and it's special because it's the only even prime.\n",
    "2.  **Check for divisibility:** For any number `n` greater than 2, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and `n` itself. \n",
    "    *   We can try dividing `n` by all numbers from 2 up to `n-1`.\n",
    "    *   If we find *any* number in that range that divides `n` perfectly (i.e., `is_divisible(n, divisor)` is `True`), then `n` is NOT prime.\n",
    "    *   If we go through all those numbers and none of them divide `n`, then `n` IS prime.\n",

    "For example, to check if 7 is prime:\n",

    "*   Is 7 divisible by 2? No (7 % 2 = 1).\n",

    "*   Is 6 divisible by 2? Yes! (6 % 2 = 0).\n",

    "\n",
    "Take a moment to think about how we approached this problem:\n",
    "1.  **Understood the Goal:** We wanted to find prime numbers.\n",
    "2.  **Defined Key Terms:** We made sure we knew what a prime number was.\n",
    "3.  **Broke It Down:** This was crucial! Instead of trying to solve everything at once, we identified smaller, manageable pieces:\n",
    "    *   How to check for divisibility (`is_divisible` or using `%`).\n",
    "    *   How to check if a *single* number is prime (`is_prime`).\n",
    "    *   How to loop through many numbers and collect the primes.\n",
    "4.  **Built Incrementally:** We built and tested each piece. For example, we made sure `is_prime` worked before using it to generate a list of primes.\n",
    "5.  **Used the Right Tools:** We identified Python features that helped us, like the modulo operator (`%`), `for` loops, `range()`, `if` statements, functions, and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of breaking down a problem, building small parts, and then combining them is a very common and powerful strategy in programming and many other fields.\n",

    "*   What part of this problem-solving process did you find most helpful or interesting?\n",
    "*   Were there any parts where you got stuck or had to rethink your approach?\n",

    "*   The importance of problem-solving strategies like breaking down complex problems.\n",
    "*   Using the modulo operator (`%`) to check for divisibility.\n",
    "*   Reinforcing our knowledge of functions, `for` loops with `range()`, conditional logic (`if`/`else`), and lists.\n",
    "*   Building a function to check if a single number is prime (`is_prime`).\n",
    "*   Combining these pieces to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "*   Prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1 with only two divisors: 1 and themselves.\n",
    "*   The modulo operator (`%`) is key for divisibility checks: `a % b == 0` means `a` is divisible by `b`.\n",
    "*   Functions help organize code and make it reusable (e.g., `is_divisible`, `is_prime`).\n",
    "*   Loops are essential for repetitive tasks, like checking many potential divisors or iterating through a range of numbers.\n",
    "*   Breaking down problems makes them much easier to solve!"
