    "**Multiplying two large prime numbers is easy. Finding the original two prime numbers when given only their product is hard (for very large numbers).**\n",

    "*   If I tell you to multiply 13 by 17, you can quickly tell me the answer is 221.\n",

But factoring a number that large would take even the fastest supercomputers trillions of years! This difference in difficulty is the magic behind many modern encryption systems."
