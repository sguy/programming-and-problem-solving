    "# Notebook 7: Organizing with Lists üìã\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our seventh Python notebook! In the last lesson, you learned how to give your programs decision-making power with `if`, `elif`, and `else`. That's a huge step!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll tackle another fundamental part of programming: how to store and manage **collections of items** using a powerful tool called a **list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Create empty lists and lists with initial items.\n",
    "*   Add items to a list using the `.append()` method.\n",
    "*   Understand the concept of a **method** as a function that belongs to an object.\n",
    "*   Get the number of items in a list using the `len()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 25-35 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites/Review:**\n",
    "*   Variables and Data Types (Notebook 2)\n",
    "*   Getting User Input with `input()` (Notebook 4)\n",
