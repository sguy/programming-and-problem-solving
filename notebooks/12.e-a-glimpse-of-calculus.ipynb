        "**Attempt 1: The Low-Tech Way**\n",
        "You could start a timer when the pitcher releases the ball and stop it when the catcher catches it. The distance from the pitcher's mound to home plate is 60.5 feet. If the ball takes 0.4 seconds to travel that distance, you can calculate the speed:\n",
        "`Speed = Distance / Time = 60.5 feet / 0.4 s = 151.25 feet/sec` (about 103 mph).\n",
        "\n",
        "But is that the *true* speed of the pitch? Not really. The ball is fastest when it leaves the pitcher's hand and slows down due to air resistance. What you've calculated is the **average speed** over the entire path.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we were to plot the ball's position over time, this measurement is equivalent to finding the slope of a line connecting the start and end points of the journey. This line, which connects two points on a curve, is called a **secant line**. The slope of this secant line gives you the *average rate of change* over that interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also think of this as **average sensitivity**. It answers the question: on average, how sensitive is the ball's position to a change in time? A high value means the position changes a lot for a little bit of time, while a low value means it doesn't change much."
