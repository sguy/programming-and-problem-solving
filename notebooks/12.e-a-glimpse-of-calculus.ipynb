        "**Attempt 1: The Low-Tech Way**\n",
        "You could start a timer when the pitcher releases the ball and stop it when the catcher catches it. The distance is about 60 feet. If it took 0.4 seconds, you could calculate: `Speed = 60 feet / 0.4 s = 150 feet/sec` (about 102 mph). But is that the speed of the pitch? Not really. The ball starts fast and slows down due to air resistance. What you measured was the *average* speed over the entire path.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Attempt 2: A Better Way**\n",
        "To get a better estimate of the peak speed, you could set up two laser gates just one foot apart right in front of the pitcher. You measure the tiny time it takes to travel between the gates. This is a much better measurement of the ball's speed as it leaves the pitcher's hand. You have found the average speed over a much smaller interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Attempt 3: The High-Tech Way**\n",
        "A radar gun does something even better. It uses the Doppler effect to measure the speed over an incredibly tiny interval of time, giving a very, very good approximation of the instantaneous speed. But even this is still an average! It's just an average over a microscopic interval. In the real world, every measurement of a changing value is an average.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Calculus Way**\n",
        "This is exactly what we have been doing! The slope of the **secant line** between two points is the **average rate of change** over that interval. To get closer to the true *instantaneous* rate of changeâ€”a theoretical, perfect valueâ€”we need to make the interval between our measurement points smaller and smaller. In this notebook, we'll see what happens as we shrink our time interval `h` to zero, giving us our first real glimpse of the concept of the **limit**."
