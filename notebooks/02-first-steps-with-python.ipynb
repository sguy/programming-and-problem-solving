    "3. Spread jelly on the other slice.\n",
    "4. Put the two slices together.\n",

    "**Why do we program?**\n",
    "*   To automate tasks (let the computer do repetitive work).\n",
    "*   To create cool things like games, websites, and apps.\n",

    "*   To solve complex problems that would be too hard or take too long for a human to do alone.\n",

    "*   They cannot start with a number. (e.g., `1stPlace` is not allowed, but\n",

    "*   Variable names are case-sensitive. This means `myVariable`, `MyVariable`,\n",
    "    and `myvariable` are all different variables.\n",
    "*   You cannot use Python's reserved keywords as variable names (e.g., you\n",
    "    can't name a variable `print`, `if`, `for`, `while`, etc., because these\n",
    "    words have special meanings in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices (Good ideas to follow):**\n",
    "*   **Be Descriptive:** Choose names that clearly indicate what the variable is\n",
    "    storing. `userName` is better than `u` or `x`.\n",
    "*   **Use `snake_case` for Multi-Word Names:** This is the most common\n",
    "    convention in Python. Separate words with underscores, and use all\n",
    "    lowercase letters. For example: `player_score`, `item_list`, `first_name`.\n",
    "*   **Be Consistent:** Stick to one naming style throughout your project.\n",
    "*   **Avoid Single-Letter Names (Usually):** While `i`, `j`, `k` are sometimes\n",

    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation (the spaces at the beginning of a line) to define blocks of code. Unlike many other languages, this is not just for readability; it's a strict rule! If you add extra spaces where they don't belong, Python will complain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Highlighting Clue:**\n",
    "Syntax highlighting might *not* always catch this one before you run the code, as a line with leading spaces might still look like valid Python elements. This makes the error message even more important.\n",
    "However, some more advanced editors or linters integrated into Jupyter might show a **red squiggly line** or a warning for unexpected indentation.\n",
    "Try running the cell below, which has an unnecessary space before `user_name`:"

    "**The Fix:**\n",

    "1.  **Don't Panic!** Everyone sees error messages. They are helpful guides.\n",
    "2.  **Read the Whole Message:** Start from the bottom (the error type and description) and work your way up if needed.\n",
    "3.  **Check the Line Number:** The traceback usually points you to the problematic line.\n",
    "4.  **Look for Typos:** Small mistakes like misspelled variable names, missing commas, parentheses, or quotes are very common. Syntax highlighting can sometimes help you spot these if a color looks \"wrong,\" or if you see a **red squiggly line** under a piece of code.\n",
    "5.  **Google It:** Copy the last line of the error message (e.g., `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`) and paste it into a search engine. You'll often find explanations and solutions from others who've had the same problem!\n",
    "6.  **Simplify:** If you wrote a lot of code and then got an error, try commenting out recent changes or running smaller parts of your code to isolate where the problem is.\n",
    "7.  **Experiment:** Try making small changes and re-running the code. This is a great way to learn.\n",
