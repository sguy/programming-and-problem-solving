    "*   Variable names can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and\n",
    "    the underscore character (<code>_</code>).\n",
    "*   They cannot start with a number. (e.g., <code>1stPlace</code> is not allowed, but\n",
    "    <code>firstPlace</code> or <code>place1</code> is fine).\n",
    "*   Variable names are case-sensitive. This means <code>myVariable</code>, <code>MyVariable</code>,\n",
    "    and <code>myvariable</code> are all different variables.\n",
    "*   You cannot use Python's reserved keywords as variable names (e.g., you\n",
    "    can't name a variable <code>print</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, etc., because these\n",
    "    words have special meanings in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Best Practices (Good ideas to follow):</strong>\n",
    "*   <strong>Be Descriptive:</strong> Choose names that clearly indicate what the variable is\n",
    "    storing. <code>userName</code> is better than <code>u</code> or <code>x</code>.\n",
    "*   <strong>Use <code>snake_case</code> for Multi-Word Names:</strong> This is the most common\n",
    "    convention in Python. Separate words with underscores, and use all\n",
    "    lowercase letters. For example: <code>player_score</code>, <code>item_list</code>, <code>first_name</code>.\n",
    "*   <strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Stick to one naming style throughout your project.\n",
    "*   <strong>Avoid Single-Letter Names (Usually):</strong> While <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> are sometimes\n",
    "    used for simple loop counters, and <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code> for coordinates,\n",
    "    generally prefer more descriptive names.\n",

    "3.  **Check the Line Number:** The traceback usually points you to the problematic line.\n",
    "4.  **Look for Typos:** Small mistakes like misspelled variable names, missing commas, parentheses, or quotes are very common. Syntax highlighting can sometimes help you spot these if a color looks \"wrong,\" or if you see a **red squiggly line** under a piece of code.\n",
    "5.  **Google It:** Copy the last line of the error message (e.g., `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`) and paste it into a search engine. You'll often find explanations and solutions from others who've had the same problem!\n",
    "6.  **Simplify:** If you wrote a lot of code and then got an error, try commenting out recent changes or running smaller parts of your code to isolate where the problem is.\n",
    "7.  **Experiment:** Try making small changes and re-running the code. This is a great way to learn.\n",
