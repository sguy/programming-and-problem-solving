    "*   Variable names are case-sensitive. This means `myVariable`, `MyVariable`,\n",
    "    and `myvariable` are all different variables.\n",
    "*   You cannot use Python's reserved keywords as variable names (e.g., you\n",
    "    can't name a variable `print`, `if`, `for`, `while`, etc., because these\n",
    "    words have special meanings in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices (Good ideas to follow):**\n",
    "*   **Be Descriptive:** Choose names that clearly indicate what the variable is\n",
    "    storing. `userName` is better than `u` or `x`.\n",
    "*   **Use `snake_case` for Multi-Word Names:** This is the most common\n",
    "    convention in Python. Separate words with underscores, and use all\n",
    "    lowercase letters. For example: `player_score`, `item_list`, `first_name`.\n",
    "*   **Be Consistent:** Stick to one naming style throughout your project.\n",
    "*   **Avoid Single-Letter Names (Usually):** While `i`, `j`, `k` are sometimes\n",

    "    generally prefer more descriptive names.\n",
