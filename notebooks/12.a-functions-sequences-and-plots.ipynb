We saw how a simple rule, expressed as a Python function, can generate a sequence of data. By plotting that data, we were able to instantly see the fundamental difference between linear and quadratic growth. As you worked through the material, you may have noticed how turning a mathematical formula into a function and then creating a plot felt like a powerful way to explore an idea. Is it easier to understand the difference between `2*x` and `x**2` by looking at the formulas or by looking at their graphs?
