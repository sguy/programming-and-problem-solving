    "\n",
    "Welcome to your tenth notebook! So far, we've used variables to store single pieces of information and lists to store ordered sequences. But what if you have a bunch of related information that isn't just a simple sequence? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore one of Python's most powerful and versatile data structures: the **dictionary**. We'll learn how to use dictionaries to organize complex data for a simple game, and along the way, we'll also learn about a modern and powerful way to format strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand what a dictionary is and how it differs from a list.\n",
    "* Create, access, modify, and remove items from a dictionary.\n",
    "* Use f-strings for clear and concise output of dictionary data.\n",
    "* Iterate over the keys and values of a dictionary.\n",
    "* Store complex data, like lists and other dictionaries, inside a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have a good understanding of the following concepts from previous lessons:\n",
