    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to use these skills to solve some practical problems: calculating properties of shapes! We'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Using basic math operations in Python.\n",
    "*   Understanding the order of operations.\n",
    "*   Performing calculations with pre-defined (hardcoded) values.\n",

    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Perform basic arithmetic calculations in Python using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.\n",
    "*   Understand operator precedence and how to use parentheses `()` to control the order of calculations.\n",

    "**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes\n",

    "**Prerequisites/Review:**\n",
