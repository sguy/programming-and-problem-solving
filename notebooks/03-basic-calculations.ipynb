    "*   Python uses standard arithmetic operators: `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), and `/` (divide).\n",
    "*   The exponent operator `**` is used for powers (e.g., `5**2` is 5-squared) and roots (e.g., `9**0.5` is the square root of 9).\n",
    "*   Python follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Use parentheses `()` to control the order and make your code clearer.\n",
